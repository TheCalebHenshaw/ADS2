To-Do for AE2


Question 1:
- Setup scanner to read in the input
- Write a function to see if the input is empty or not one of the following "[]{}()". If there are any spaces, strip the String
- Discuss why I can use a stack structure to solve my problem

Algorithm:
Initialize empty stack of Characters
Iterate thru each Characters
If the current char is an opening paranthesis, push it onto the stack
If the current character is a closing parenthesis, check for empty stack, if it is then return false because no matching
If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack and check fi it matches the current closing, if not then return false


Question 2:

B)
Find orderings of insertion to make 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 

C)
Possibly finished

D)
